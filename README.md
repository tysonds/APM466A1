Assignment 1-Tyson Dennis-Sharma

In this assignment, I use real-data on Canadian Government Bonds to construct a yield, spot rate and forward rate curve. 
Moreoever, I compute a covariance matrix to analyze the principal components of the daily log returns of different 
bond yields (for bonds maturing between 0 and 5 years from now).
